# Description
 Find it difficult to sell or browse basic household, school or life items? Posted or searched for various sites but location and reach is a problem? Our team has created a web application where the user can login and select their specific university to sell or buy products in their local community. Think of this application as a combination of Facebook and Craigslist with a focus on your local campus!

This app allows a user to login or signup for an account, select the University they attend, and start browsing, buying or selling items. It's that easy!

This project was a collaborative effort between myself and my fellow programmers listed below in the Contributors section. We used the MVC (model-view-controller) paradigm for structuring our files.
